# Pluma LMS (Node.js)
A learning management system that combines popular solutions for education into an all-in-one, catch-all package.

## Design principles
Pluma (Node.js) keeps several key points in mind. These are:
- Object-oriented, easy-to-understand code.
- Speed is emphasized.
- Pluma intends to replace many different, fragmented, and incomplete learning management systems and other educational software such as Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, Weebly, Edmodo, Home Access Center/Teacher Access Center, Remind.com, Eduphoria. There is no need to use all of these different softwares and services with a monolithic, complete LMS never seen before like Pluma.
- All Pluma components (e.g. notification system, gradebook management, etc.) are comprehensive in features; designed with students, teachers, and faculty in mind; and intricately work with each other.
- A secure, easy-to-use, and logical API that serves as the backend of the software.

# Requirements
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Google Chrome for Pluma LMS endusers.

# Download and installation
You may download the latest stable release of Pluma LMS (Node.js) from above.

Currently, installation requires the system administrator to do stuff with Node.js.

After that, your installation is complete. Pluma LMS (Node.js) is committed to speed so we will add shell script BS (```npm``` and the whole nine yards).
